# PyTorch Paper Implementations

This repository contains my from-scratch implementations of various deep learning papers using PyTorch. Each implementation is meant to be educational, helping me (and hopefully others) understand the architectures and techniques described in influential papers.

## Implementations

### 1. UNet
ðŸ“‚ `UNet-pt/`
- Implementation of [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
- Architecture for image segmentation with encoder-decoder structure and skip connections
- [Details](https://github.com/mahmoud-maan/pytorch-paper-implementations/tree/main/UNet-pt)

*More implementations coming soon...*

## Structure

Each paper implementation is contained in its own folder with:
- `model.py` - The PyTorch implementation
- `README.md` - Explanation specific to that paper
- Additional files as needed (training scripts, utilities, etc.)

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
1. A learning resource for understanding deep learning architectures
2. A reference for implementing papers from scratch
3. A collection of working PyTorch implementations

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- Python 3.x
- Additional requirements may vary by implementation (see individual READMEs)

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements.
